> ### Lab 4: Exercise 2
>  - Using the lab as a reference I am using a mouse click as an event.
>  - I use an observer pattern to check for the click and play a click sound.
> ---
>  - For the score and charge I use a singleton pattern to ensure that only one instance of the text exists at a time.
> ---
>  - In my approach, when you click the black background you gain 1 charge and when you accumulate 10 charge it resets and increments the score by 1.
